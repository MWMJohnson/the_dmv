# The DMV


## Reflection
  1. I first researched best methods and processes to debug code to help put me in a systematic mindset. I first glanced over the pre-existing code to get an understanding of what was going and tried to summarize that in my own words. Next I noted lines of code that just seemed off or like they were missing something. Then I ran a test for each file and would isolate each test using the ":##" at the end of rspec, and would read the error message twice and use the stack trace to guide me through the test and error/failure. Then would implement a potential solution and repeated until error/failure was gone for each test in each file. 

  2. Trying to discern if the test or actual code was off, I am very thankful y'all gave that tip or I might have lost a ton of time thinking I needed to re-write the tests.

  3. It was easier to understand what was going on and how the code was connected than I expected. I was anxious and truly expecting to be reading a foreign language, but when I went line by line verbally speaking out what the code was doing, it was not so intimidating.
